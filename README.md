# WeatherApp
WeatherApp gives you the weather in real time in any given place on the planet, displayed on a map(coded with Express.js).

See it in action: https://thisistheweatherman.herokuapp.com/

**Features:**

- Responsive interface (designed with Bootstrap)
- Sign-up/Sign-in feature with a NoSQL database
- Locations displayed on an interactive map
- Save any number of cities
- Weather data come from the Open Weather Map API

_Logging in with a different user will still display the cities you saved with the first user. I designed this app just to have fun with a weather API, I did not focus on the sign-in logic._
